   - *Mitigation*: Incremental changes, performance monitoring
   - *Contingency*: Feature flags, rollback procedures

3. **ML Model Accuracy**
   - *Risk*: Complex models underperform simple forecasting
   - *Mitigation*: A/B testing, performance baselines
   - *Contingency*: Ensemble fallback to linear models

### Medium Risk Factors
1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - *Risk*: Optimization breaks specific browsers
   - *Mitigation*: Cross-browser testing automation
   - *Contingency*: Progressive enhancement strategy

2. **Data Migration**
